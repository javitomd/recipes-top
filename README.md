Practice project while learning html

In this project, we'll create a recipes website. I have a sort of cooking blog in mind, and hope it will be a hard task, which will take time, but hopefully will come out as a great tool to practice.

I believe we'll be putting into practice many of the things we've been studying throughout the curriculum, such as, tags, content, elements, and attributes. We'll also be using links to connect different pages to each other, and images to make the website look nice.

Also, this will be an amazing opportunity to practice git uses and github to update the repository and getting better at writing commit messages.
