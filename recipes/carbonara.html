        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a delicious, rich, creamy sauce with cheese and pancetta 
            (or bacon, if like me you can't be bothered to go out and buy pancetta).
            What makes this sauce a bit unusual is that it isn't thickened with cream 
            (although this is a nice addition) or a roux like you would expect, but with
            egg.</p>
        <p>This makes it even easier to prepare, and adds a bit of extra protein 
            (so you can even pretend it's healthy!).
        Now let's check the recipe for the perfect carbonara.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>In order to have the best carbonara possible we need to follow the next steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm
                to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon
                olive oil, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly 
                browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving
                2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. 
                Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. 
                Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. 
                Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems
                dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly
                with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2
                cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. 
                Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
            <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
        </ol>
