        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a delicious, rich, creamy sauce with cheese and pancetta 
            (or bacon, if like me you can't be bothered to go out and buy pancetta).
            What makes this sauce a bit unusual is that it isn't thickened with cream 
            (although this is a nice addition) or a roux like you would expect, but with
            egg.</p>
        <p>This makes it even easier to prepare, and adds a bit of extra protein 
            (so you can even pretend it's healthy!).
        Now let's check the recipe for the perfect carbonara.</p>
