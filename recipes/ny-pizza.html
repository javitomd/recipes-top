        <h1>New York Style Pizza</h1>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>New York-style pizza hails from New York City. 
            It's known for its circular shape, cut into huge wedges with a thin 
            and foldable (but still crisp) crust and topped with mozzarella cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle yeast over surface of warm water in a large bowl. 
                Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. Mix in flour, salt,
                and olive oil. When dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a
                floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more 
                flour if dough is too sticky. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, 
                and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a 
                pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf.</li>
            <li>When dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface.
                Roll or stretch out into a 12-inch circle, and place on a baking pan.
                If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of 
                parchment while preheating the stone in the oven.</li>
            <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough. Sprinkle with oregano, 
                mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese, and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottom of
                crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese 
                is melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and
                serving.</li>
        </ol>
