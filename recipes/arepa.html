        <p>Arepas are a traditional venezuelan dish, prepared with very few ingredients, but
            very delicious. This is what venezuelan families usually eat for breakfast and dinner.
            <p>There are no limits to what you can put inside of them, which also makes them very flexible
            and versatile when it comes to flavor.</p> 
            <p>However, for this recipe we'll keep it simple,
            as the most traditional way to eat them is with just butter and cheese.
            Easy, fast and yummy! Let's get to it...

        <p>For this recipe we'll need the following ingredients</p>

                dough.</li>
            <li>Take a small part of the dough to make a ball with it.</li>
            <li>Press the ball with your hands until the ball looks like a circle.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once your circle looks nice, put it in the preheated pan.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Cook the arepas until they get a golden color and tap them with a knife to check they are crunchy.</li>

        <p>Once your arepas look similar to the ones on the picture, get them out of the pan and put them

            <li>Grate your mozarella cheese and have it ready.</li>
            <li>Open your arepas with a knife.</li>
